# web_scraping-challenge

For this project, I used Splinter to extract information from a webpage. First I had to identify the HTML elements on the webpage using inspect. I also utilized Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML to Python and stored in dictionaries with a Python list. I then printed the list to my Jupyter notebook. 

For part 2 of this project, I scraped information from a table on a different website. I then used the scraped data to create a Pandas DataFrame where the columns had the same headings as the website table. I then had to rename some of the data types in order to further analyze the data using Pandas functions. Last, I exported the DataFrame to a CSV file.

I utilzed Ask BCS, tutoring as well as chat gpt to complete this project.
